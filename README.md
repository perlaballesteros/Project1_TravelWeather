# Project1_TravelWeather

DESCRIPTION:
The app lets users enter their start location, destination and the distance in between points to diplay weather information along their route.This is so they can plan accordingly. 

MOTIVATION:
The app idea came from Darwood(teamate). When he went on long distance motorcycle rides, he often encountered unexpected weather conditions thus putting a "damper" on his adventure for not being prepared. 

RESULTS: 
Overall our app accomplished our initial goal,provide an application that would give users weather information along their route. 

TEAMEFFORTS:
We formed two groups based on what we preferred to work on. Darwood and I worked mostly on the javascript, with Alan and Trevor helping out.Alan and Trevor focused on the styling and layout of our app. We divided up the coding into smaller tasks then once a simpler version was accomplished and made sure it worked, we added the next level of complexity.

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSABILITIES:
PerlaB:
1)Darwood and I worked on setting the APIs making sure they worked properly.
2)I helped Darwood setup the epoly extension. Turned the getPointsAtDistance from epoly to a function in our javascript.
3)Came up with the function and the logic for calculating the time the user will be pass through the points these two functions(calcwaypointTime and waypointDuration).
4)Responsible for setting up the infowindow and the content from the underweather api.
5)Darwood and I debugged together those console.logs sure turned out to be our bffs.
	CHALLENGES:
	Working from existing code and eliminating the urge to rewrite when I had trouble understanding. Keeping an organized code. Debugging and compromising between our teams differing ideas. Keep trying when things have failed multiple times.

IMPROVEMENTS:
1)Organize and conscise the code for better readability. 
2)opening the marker infowindow when a div is pressed. 
3)Having a scroll bar for the divs displaying weather so you don't have to scroll the whole page and loose the map.
