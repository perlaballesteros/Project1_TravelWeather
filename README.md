# Project1_TravelWeather

DESCRIPTION:
The app lets users enter their start location, destination and the distance in between points to diplay weather information along their route.This is so they can plan accordingly. 

MOTIVATION:
The app idea came from Darwood. When he went on long distance motorcycle rides, he often encountered unexpected weather conditions thus putting a "damper" on his adventure. 

RESULTS: 
Overall our app accomplished our initial goal,provide an application that would give users weather information along their route. Our app works correctly when entering distance smaller than a day duration, but seems to malfunction for some long distance routes. 

TEAMEFFORTS:
We formed two groups based on what we preferred to work on. Darwood and I worked mostly on the javascript, with Alan and Trevor helping out.Alan and Trevor focused on the styling and layout of our app. We divided up the coding into smaller tasks then once a simpler version was accomplished and made sure it worked, we added the next level of complexity.

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSABILITIES:
---------------------------------------------
PerlaB:
I was responsible along with Darwood for verifying that our APIS were returning the correct response. I made sure that the epoly extension.The functiton from epoly.js,to get the markersdistance did not work as expected,so I turned into a function in our javascript file. I was also reposnsible for making the functions which took the duration time, added it to the current time at the waypoint and return the time inhrs, days that would eventually go to the underweatherApi. I also contributed troughout made the ajax call to get the current time at the waypoint. Darwood and I worked together to debug our program. Those console.logs were everything. 
	CHALLENGES:
	Working from other peoples code and eliminating the urge to rewrite when I had trouble understanding. Keeping an organized code. Debugging and compromising between our teams differing ideas. Keep trying when things have failed multiple times.
---------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:
Organize and conscise the code for better readability. Having the div highlight when the user presses the marker. Find more efficient ways of accessing.Making our app faster and more precise.
